# In this SQL analysis project, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customers, order, and date/location data. 

# Q1) How many many unique orders were placed in January? In other words, how many distinct order ids do we have? 

SELECT COUNT( DISTINCT orderID )
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';

# Q2) How many of those orders were for an iPhone?

SELECT COUNT( DISTINCT orderID )
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID'
AND Product = 'iPhone';

# Q3) Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.

SELECT DISTINCT acctnum 
FROM BIT_DB.customers custs

INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
ON custs.order_id = Feb.orderID

WHERE length(Feb.orderID) = 6
AND Feb.orderID <> 'Order ID';

# Q4) Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?

SELECT DISTINCT Product, price
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
ORDER BY price ASC
LIMIT 1;

# Q5) What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?

SELECT Product
, SUM( price ) * quantity as Revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY Product;



# Q6) Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?

SELECT Product
, SUM( quantity)
, SUM( price ) * quantity as Revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY Product;

# Q7) How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?

SELECT
COUNT( DISTINCT custs.acctnum ) as CountCustomers
, AVG(price * quantity) as Average
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers custs
ON Feb.orderID = custs.order_id
WHERE Feb.quantity > 2
AND length(Feb.orderID) = 6
AND Feb.orderID <> 'Order ID';
