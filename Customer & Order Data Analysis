# In this SQL analysis project, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customers, order, and date/location data. 

# Q1) How many many unique orders were placed in January? In other words, how many distinct order ids do we have?

# Q4) Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
