# For this project, I downloaded the Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Then, I created an SQL table to put in Spotify data.
# Finally, I performed data analysis on the table using SQL. 

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

# Then I inserted all values of the the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

# Finally, I explored the data using the following SQL.

# Q1) Rank the top 10 most danceable songs in the list. List the artist and song. 

SELECT artist_name, track_name
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY danceability DESC
LIMIT 10;

# Q2) Give me the artist names that have a popularity score greater than 90, and have an energy score higher than 0.700.

SELECT artist_name
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE popularity > 90
AND energy > 0.700
ORDER BY energy DESC;

# Q3) Calculate the average popularity for the artists in the Spotify data table. Then, for every artist with an average popularity of 90 or above, 
# show their name, their average popularity, and label them as a “Top Star”.

WITH popAvgCTE AS (
SELECT spot.artist_name,
AVG(spot.popularity) AS average_pop
FROM SpotifyData spot
GROUP BY spot.artist_name
ORDER BY average_pop ASC
)
 
SELECT artist_name, average_pop,'Top Star' AS tag
FROM popAvgCTE
WHERE average_pop >= 90;
